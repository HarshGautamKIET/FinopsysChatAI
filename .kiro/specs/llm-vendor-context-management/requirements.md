# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FinOpSysAI application requires enhanced LLM model integration with robust vendor context management to ensure secure, vendor-specific data access and analysis. This feature will implement a context-aware chat application that connects with multiple LLM models (with failover capabilities) and a PostgreSQL database to generate vendor-specific responses while maintaining strict security boundaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: LLM Model Integration and Failover

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to automatically connect to available LLM models with failover capabilities, so that users always have access to AI assistance even if the primary model is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL attempt to connect to OpenAI API as the primary LLM model.
2. IF the OpenAI model connection fails THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to connect to Google Gemini as a fallback.
3. IF both OpenAI and Gemini connections fail THEN the system SHALL attempt to connect to Ollama local models.
4. WHEN a model connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and attempt the next model in the failover sequence.
5. WHEN the user explicitly selects a different LLM model THEN the system SHALL switch to the selected model if available.
6. WHEN switching between LLM models THEN the system SHALL maintain the current vendor context and session state.
7. WHEN any LLM model is active THEN the system SHALL enforce response guidelines to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

### Requirement 2: Database Connection and Vendor Context Establishment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely connect to my vendor-specific data through a guided setup process, so that I can only access data relevant to my vendor account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM model is successfully initialized THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using credentials from the environment configuration.
2. WHEN the database connection is established THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select a case_id from available options.
3. WHEN a case_id is selected THEN the system SHALL query the database to retrieve the corresponding vendor_id.
4. WHEN the vendor_id is retrieved THEN the system SHALL lock the session context to that vendor_id for all subsequent operations.
5. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps.
6. IF the vendor_id cannot be retrieved for a selected case_id THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prompt for another selection.
7. WHEN the vendor context is established THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message without revealing the actual vendor_id value.

### Requirement 3: Secure Query Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to query my financial data using natural language, so that I can easily analyze my invoices without writing SQL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL generate a SQL query that always includes the vendor_id filter.
2. WHEN generating SQL queries THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. WHEN executing database queries THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting according to the configured threshold.
4. WHEN processing query results THEN the system SHALL remove sensitive identifiers (case_id, customer_id, vendor_id, bill_id, invoice_id) before displaying to the user.
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL maintain a dual data structure that preserves complete data internally while filtering sensitive fields from the frontend display.
6. WHEN the user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain the vendor context filter in all subsequent queries.
7. IF a query attempts to bypass vendor filtering THEN the system SHALL reject the query and log a security warning.

### Requirement 4: Response Formatting and Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want well-formatted, insightful responses to my queries, so that I can easily understand the financial data and extract meaningful insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL format currency values with appropriate symbols and decimal places.
2. WHEN displaying financial summaries THEN the system SHALL use bold formatting for important terms and values.
3. WHEN responding to different query types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate section headers (Financial Summary, Product Analysis, Payment Status, etc.).
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL organize information with proper line breaks and spacing for readability.
5. WHEN processing item-level data THEN the system SHALL intelligently parse and expand JSON arrays and CSV formatted items.
6. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL replace specific identifiers with generic terms (e.g., "your account" instead of "vendor_id: V123").
7. WHEN providing analysis THEN the system SHALL include relevant metrics and insights based on the query context.

### Requirement 5: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the system to enforce strict security measures, so that sensitive financial data remains protected and compliant with data privacy requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any data THEN the system SHALL enforce vendor isolation to prevent cross-vendor data access.
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL follow the response guidelines to prevent exposure of sensitive identifiers.
3. WHEN handling user sessions THEN the system SHALL implement proper session timeout and management.
4. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL restrict operations to read-only SELECT statements.
5. WHEN logging system activity THEN the system SHALL record security events without exposing sensitive data.
6. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL implement case-insensitive filtering of both lowercase and uppercase variations of sensitive field names.
7. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide informative messages without revealing system internals or sensitive data.
