# JSON Virtual Row Expansion for FinOpsys ChatAI

## Overview

The FinOpsys ChatAI system now supports **virtual row expansion** for invoice data where multiple items are stored as JSON arrays in single database fields. This enables users to query individual items as if each item were stored in its own database row.

## Problem Solved

Previously, if invoice data was stored like this:
```
CASE_ID: INV001
ITEMS_DESCRIPTION: ["Office Chair", "Standing Desk", "Monitor"]
ITEMS_UNIT_PRICE: ["250.00", "800.00", "300.00"]
ITEMS_QUANTITY: ["4", "2", "3"]
```

Users could only query at the invoice level. They couldn't ask questions like:
- "Show me Office Chair details"
- "What's the price of Standing Desk?"
- "Find all items with quantity greater than 2"

## Solution: Virtual Row Expansion

The system now automatically detects when item fields contain JSON arrays and expands them into virtual rows:

**Original Invoice (1 row):**
```
CASE_ID | ITEMS_DESCRIPTION                              | ITEMS_UNIT_PRICE        | ITEMS_QUANTITY
INV001  | ["Office Chair", "Standing Desk", "Monitor"]   | ["250.00", "800.00", "300.00"] | ["4", "2", "3"]
```

**Expanded Virtual Rows (3 rows):**
```
CASE_ID | ITEM_INDEX | ITEM_DESCRIPTION | ITEM_UNIT_PRICE | ITEM_QUANTITY | ITEM_LINE_TOTAL
INV001  | 1          | Office Chair     | 250.00          | 4             | 1000.00
INV001  | 2          | Standing Desk    | 800.00          | 2             | 1600.00
INV001  | 3          | Monitor          | 300.00          | 3             | 900.00
```

## Supported Data Formats

The system handles multiple data formats automatically:

### 1. JSON Arrays (Primary Format)
```json
["Office Chair", "Standing Desk", "Monitor"]
["250.00", "800.00", "300.00"]
["4", "2", "3"]
```

### 2. CSV/Comma-Separated Values
```
Office Chair, Standing Desk, Monitor
250.00, 800.00, 300.00
4, 2, 3
```

### 3. Other Delimited Formats
```
Office Chair; Standing Desk; Monitor
Office Chair | Standing Desk | Monitor
```

### 4. PostgreSQL Arrays (Python Lists)
```python
['Office Chair', 'Standing Desk', 'Monitor']
[250.0, 800.0, 300.0]
[4, 2, 3]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Query Detection
The system automatically detects when users are asking item-level questions:

**Item-Level Queries:**
- "Show me Office Chair details"
- "What items cost more than $500?"
- "List all Software License purchases"
- "Find items with quantity greater than 2"

**Product-Specific Queries:**
- "What's the price of Audit Report?"
- "How much did we spend on Cloud Storage?"
- "Show me all Monitor purchases"

### 2. Enhanced Product Extraction
The system can extract product names from natural language queries:

```
"Show me Office Chair details" â†’ ["Office Chair"]
"What's the price of Audit Report?" â†’ ["Audit Report"]
"Find Cloud Storage purchases" â†’ ["Cloud Storage"]
```

### 3. Rich Statistics and Analytics
When items are expanded, the system provides comprehensive statistics:

```
ðŸ“ˆ Item Statistics:
â€¢ Total line items: 9
â€¢ Total value: $9,450.00
â€¢ Average item price: $755.56
â€¢ Most common items:
  - Office Chair (4 times)
  - Software License (2 times)
  - Monitor (3 times)
```

### 4. Intelligent Query Processing
The system decides when to apply expansion based on:
- Query type (item-level vs invoice-level)
- Data structure (presence of item fields)
- Expansion benefit (whether expansion would provide meaningful results)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **DelimitedFieldProcessor** (`utils/delimited_field_processor.py`)
   - Handles parsing of JSON arrays and delimited fields
   - Performs virtual row expansion
   - Manages query analysis and product extraction

2. **Enhanced Database Manager** (`utils/enhanced_db_manager.py`)
   - Integrates expansion with query execution
   - Provides seamless expansion when beneficial

### Key Methods

- `parse_delimited_field()` - Parses JSON arrays and delimited text
- `process_item_row()` - Expands single invoice into item rows
- `expand_results_with_items()` - Expands full query results
- `is_item_query()` - Detects item-level queries
- `is_specific_product_query()` - Detects product-specific queries
- `improve_product_extraction()` - Extracts product names from queries

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Specific Product Query
```
User: "Show me Office Chair details"

System Processing:
1. Detects item-level query: âœ“
2. Detects product-specific query: âœ“  
3. Extracts products: ["Office Chair"]
4. Generates SQL with product filtering
5. Expands results to show individual items
6. Filters expanded results to Office Chair only

Result: Shows only Office Chair line items with pricing and quantity details
```

### Example 2: General Item Query
```
User: "Show me all line items for December 2023"

System Processing:
1. Detects item-level query: âœ“
2. Generates SQL for date range
3. Expands all results to show individual items
4. Provides comprehensive item statistics

Result: Shows all individual items across all invoices in December
```

### Example 3: Quantity-Based Query
```
User: "Find all items with quantity greater than 2"

System Processing:
1. Detects item-level query: âœ“
2. Expands results to individual items
3. Filters items based on quantity criteria

Result: Shows only items where ITEM_QUANTITY > 2
```

# Your Specific Use Case: CASE203 Example

## Your Current Data Format

Your database stores items exactly as described:

```sql
CASE_ID: CASE203
BILL_DATE: 2025-05-30
ITEMS_DESCRIPTION: ["Office Chair", "Audit Report"]
ITEMS_UNIT_PRICE: [4463.3, 2581.2]
ITEMS_QUANTITY: [5, 5]
```

## Virtual Row Expansion Result

The system automatically expands this into:

```
CASE_ID    DATE         DESCRIPTION     PRICE      QTY    TOTAL
CASE203    2025-05-30   Office Chair    4463.3     5      22316.5
CASE203    2025-05-30   Audit Report    2581.2     5      12906.0
```

## What This Enables

### Independent Item Queries
Users can now ask:
- **"What is the price of Office Chair?"** â†’ Returns: $4463.3
- **"Show me items with quantity 5"** â†’ Returns: Both items
- **"What's the most expensive item in CASE203?"** â†’ Returns: Office Chair
- **"List all Audit Report purchases"** â†’ Finds all instances across invoices

### Natural Language Processing
The system understands and processes:
- Product names: "Office Chair", "Audit Report"
- Quantity comparisons: "quantity greater than 3", "exactly 5 items"
- Price analysis: "most expensive", "cheapest", "over $3000"
- Date filtering: "items purchased on 2025-05-30"

### Automatic Smart Detection
The system automatically:
- Detects when user asks item-level questions
- Parses JSON arrays into individual virtual rows
- Calculates line totals (price Ã— quantity)
- Provides item-level statistics and insights

## Technical Verification

### âœ… Tested Scenarios:
