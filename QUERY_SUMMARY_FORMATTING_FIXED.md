# Query Summary Formatting - IMPROVED

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Query summaries were presented in inline paragraph format, making responses difficult to read.

**Solution**: Enhanced the response formatting system to use clear line breaks and improved readability structure.

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced LLM Response Cleaning (`_clean_llm_response`)**

#### **Before (Problematic):**
```python
# Sentences were joined into paragraphs with spaces
current_paragraph.append(sentence)
formatted_lines.append(' '.join(current_paragraph))  # ❌ Creates inline paragraphs
```

#### **After (Fixed):**
```python
# Each sentence gets proper line breaks
formatted_lines.append(sentence)
formatted_lines.append("")  # ✅ Adds spacing for readability
formatted_text = '\n'.join(formatted_lines)  # ✅ Proper line breaks
```

### **2. Improved Sentence Processing**

- **Sentence Splitting**: Uses regex for better sentence boundary detection
- **Paragraph Starters**: Recognizes content that should start new sections
- **List Handling**: Properly formats bullet points and numbered lists
- **Emphasis**: Highlights important financial terms and amounts

### **3. Structured Response Sections**

The response now has clear sections with proper spacing:

```
💡 **Analysis:**
[Clean, formatted response with line breaks]

📊 **Data Summary:**
[Summary information]

ℹ️ **Data Insights:**
[Quality information]
```

## 📋 **FORMATTING FEATURES**

### **✅ Line Break Management**
- Each sentence on its own line
- Blank lines between logical sections
- Proper spacing for readability

### **✅ Content Enhancement**
- **Bold highlighting** for important terms (overdue, paid, balance)
- **Currency formatting** with emphasis (**$1,234.56**)
- Contextual section headers based on query type

### **✅ Section Organization**
- Financial queries → 💰 **Financial Summary**
- Product queries → 📦 **Product Analysis**
- Payment queries → ⏰ **Payment Status**
- Trend queries → 📈 **Trend Analysis**
- General queries → 💡 **Analysis**

## 🎨 **EXAMPLE OUTPUT**

### **Before (Inline Paragraph):**
```
Based on the query results, the total overdue amount is $15,234.67 and there are 12 unpaid invoices. Most of these are from Vendor ABC with amounts ranging from $500 to $3,000. The oldest overdue invoice is from March 2024.
```

### **After (Improved Formatting):**
```
💰 **Financial Summary:**

The total **overdue** amount is **$15,234.67** and there are 12 **unpaid** invoices.

Most of these are from Vendor ABC with amounts ranging from **$500** to **$3,000**.

The oldest **overdue** invoice is from March 2024.
```

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **`_clean_llm_response()` Method**: Complete rewrite for better formatting
2. **Regex Enhancement**: Better sentence splitting and pattern matching
3. **Content Processing**: Improved handling of different content types
4. **Emphasis System**: Automatic highlighting of key terms and amounts

### **Files Modified:**
- `streamlit/src/app.py` - Main response formatting logic

### **Utilities (Already Proper):**
- `utils/delimited_field_processor.py` - Item and product formatting ✅
- All utility formatters already used proper `'\n'.join()` formatting ✅

## ✅ **RESULT**

**Query summaries now display with:**
- ✅ Clear line breaks between sentences
- ✅ Proper spacing between sections
- ✅ Enhanced readability with emphasis
- ✅ Structured organization
- ✅ Professional formatting

**Query Results section remains unchanged** as requested - functioning as expected.

The response formatting now provides excellent readability while maintaining all the analytical content and insights.
